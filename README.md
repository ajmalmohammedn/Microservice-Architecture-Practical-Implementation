# Microservice-Architecture-Practical-Implementation

This repository contains simple tutorials for building microservices in [Spring](https://spring.io/) and deploying it on cloud platform like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

> Each project in this repository contains its own **README.md** file that contains detailed explanation of service that we are going to implement and deploy on the server. 

## Overview

### What are microservices?

Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others.

### Why build microservices?

Their small scale and relative isolation can lead to many additional benefits, such as easier maintenance, improved productivity, greater fault tolerance, better business alignment, and more
